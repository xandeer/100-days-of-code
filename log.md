## Day 0: January 03, 2017

### Today's Progress

Start coding with codefreecamp, reviewed Bootstrap lib.

### Thoughts

I really struggled with layout, I need code more.


## Day 01: January 04, 2017

### Today's Progress

Finished the first project with Bootstrap on codefreecamp, and resolved two simple javascript algorithm problems.

### Thoughts

Bootstrap has done something I don't know. So if a class I'll use from Bootstrap, I'd look at how it implements.

## Day 02: January 05, 2017

### Today's Progress

Resolved 5 simple javascript algorithm problems. At the same time, I tried to use `mocha` & `chai` to test my scripts.

### Thoughts

That 5 problems give me a chance to review the methods of `String` & `Array`.


## Day 03: January 06, 2017

### Today's Progress

1. Resolved 3 simple JavaScript algorithm problems.
2. Build a Echarts demo.
3. Init portfolio project.

### Thoughts

1. Meet some puzzles for testing with deep Array.
2. When I want to use webpack to start a bootstrap project, I encountered several troubles, and then I found there's a project [bootstrap-loader](https://github.com/shakacode/bootstrap-loader), that really helped me.


## Day 04: January 07, 2017

### Today's Progress

1. Resolved 3 algorithm problems.

### Thoughts

1. Reviewed Array's prototype methods: `filter`, `every`, `sort`.
