# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Start coding with codefreecamp, reviewed Bootstrap lib.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with layout, I need code more.

### Day 01: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the first project with Bootstrap on codefreecamp, and resolved two simple javascript algorithm problems.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap has done something I don't know. So if a class I'll use from Bootstrap, I'd look at how it implements.

### Day 02: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Resolved 5 simple javascript algorithm problems. At the same time, I tried to use `mocha` & `chai` to test my scripts.

**Thoughts**: That 5 problems give me a chance to review the methods of `String` & `Array`.
