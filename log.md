# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 03, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Start coding with codefreecamp, reviewed Bootstrap lib.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with layout, I need code more.

### Day 01: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the first project with Bootstrap on codefreecamp, and resolved two simple javascript algorithm problems.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap has done something I don't know. So if a class I'll use from Bootstrap, I'd look at how it implements.
