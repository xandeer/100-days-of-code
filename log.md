# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<h3 id='0'>Day 0: January 03, 2017</h3>

**Today's Progress**: Start coding with codefreecamp, reviewed Bootstrap lib.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with layout, I need code more.

<h3 id='01'>Day 01: January 04, 2017</h3>

**Today's Progress**: Finished the first project with Bootstrap on codefreecamp, and resolved two simple javascript algorithm problems.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap has done something I don't know. So if a class I'll use from Bootstrap, I'd look at how it implements.
